# Mass .paa Converter

Some .bat files to mass convert paa to png and png to paa


### Prerequisites


```
Arma 3 tools
An IDE to convert files into .bat 
```

### How It Works

The program will take every .paa or .png files in the folder where you put the .bat and the pal2pace, 
It's gonna proceed every files in the two formats and make it in the wanted format.

## Installing

```
* 1st make a folder on your desktop or somewhere you want to find your converter (for this example we will use the /Desktop/Paascripts folder)
* 2nd Open Arma 3 Tools folder (in \Steam\steamapps\common\Arma 3 Tools)
* 3rd Open the TexView2 folder and copy "Pal2PacE.exe" into "/Desktop/Paascripts"
* 4th paste all the .bat into your "/Desktop/Paascripts" folder
```

## Using


```
Now you got your "/Desktop/Paascripts" folder with :
- paatopng.bat
- Pal2PacE.exe
- pngtopaa.bat
```

```
To use this script just copy the .bat that you want (for the next example i want to convert paa to png)
* 1st Copy paatopng.bat and Pal2PacE.exe where the .paa are stored
* 2nd run the .bat files
* 3rd enjoy your .png files and modify it as you want
```

## Tips

* This scripts just allow you to convert massively .paa to .png and .png to .paa
* Please do not use it to steal/modify files without the owner permission

* I know that's a very little job and nothing automatised with UI but it may usefull to some peoples.
